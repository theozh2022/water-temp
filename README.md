# Water Temp Regression Prediction" 
The project aims to develop predictive models for maximum water temperature in rivers, a critical
factor for the survival of salmonid species. This work, inspired by environmental scientist
Katharine Carter's insights on the impact of global warming on river temperatures, involved
analyzing a comprehensive dataset of daily observed air and water temperatures across 31
rivers in Spain. Through meticulous data analysis using Python, I crafted a model that predicts
water temperature fluctuations, offering insights for environmental conservation efforts.
